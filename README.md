3.Sentiment Analysis

_The main motive is to classify the reviews obtained from a site termed as metacritic.com as positive or negative_.

_Reviews having a score >85 are considered positive and those less than 50 are considered negative_.

_Before data cleaning i had 3 csv files termed as ps4,xbox and switch .These 3 were cleaned and merged together in one_.

_Same was applied for reviews as well there were two csv termed as meta review and user review.They were merged together and saved in a single file termed as review.csv_
